>>> # 1. Create a Boolean variable named x
>>> x = True
>>> # 2. Create an integer variable named y
>>> y = 1
>>> # 3. Create a float variable named z
>>> z = 2.5
>>> # 4. Create a string variable named s
>>> s = 'ahmad'

>>> # 5. Convert the int variable to float
>>> x = 3
>>> float(x)
3.0

>>> # 6. Can we convert the str to int?
>>> y = '5'
>>> int(y)
5
>>> # 7. Create a List of Numbers from 1 to 5
>>> x = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> list(range(1,6))
... [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
... 
... 
... >>> # 8. Create a tuple from 10 to 15
... >>> x = (10,11,12,13,14,15)# that is first way. 2. we can make the folowing steps also
... 
... >>> tuple(range(10,16))
... (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
... 
... >>> # 9. convert list to tuple
... 
... >>> x = [1,2,3,4]
... >>> list[x]
... list[[1, 2, 3, 4]]
... >>> tuple (x)
... (1, 2, 3, 4)
... 
... >>> # 10. Create a dict of 3 values
... >>> x = {'ahamd': 20, 'imad':30, 'hamoud':40}

... >>> # 12. Python is interpreted or compiled ?
... >>> # python it is interpreted.
... 
... >>> # 13. What is defferences between low level & high level ?
... >>> # Low level its hard to write the Code for Programer but its fast to run
... >>> # high level its easy to writing the Code but its slower to run . the differnce is the Understanding the Code between Programer and PC
