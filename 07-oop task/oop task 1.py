# 1. Explain in few words what we mean by a class give and example
class is some of few functions that we call them with class name
EX:
    class Bank:
       
    c1= Bank
    


#2. create a simple class names calculator
    class Calc:
        def __init__(self):
    c1 = Calc

#3. Create a constructor that prints Welcome message
      class Calc:
        def __init__(self):
        print('welcome')
    c1 = Calc

#4. Add 2 methods to the class sum & mull
     
 class Calc:
        def __init__(self):
        print('welcome')
        def mysum(x,y):
            result= x+y
            print(result)
c1 = Calc
c1.mysum(5,6)
#5. The sum method return the sum of 2 arguments x and y
 class Calc:
        def __init__(self):
            print('welcome')
        def mysum(x,y):
            result= x+y
            return result
c1 = Calc
print(result)

#6. The mull method return the multiplication of the arguments x and y
 class Calc:
        def __init__(self):
            print('welcome')
        def mysum(self,x,y):
            result= x*y
            return result

#7. Take an object from the class
class Calc:
       def mysum(self,x,y):
           return x+y
            print(x+y)
            

c1 = Calc()
c1.mysum(5,6)

#8. Call the sum method with 10 , 20
class Calc:
       def mysum(self,x,y):
           return x+y
            print(x+y)
       
            

c1 = Calc()
c1.mysum(10,20)

#9. Call the mull method with 10 , 20
class Calc:
     def mull(self,x,y):
            return x*y
            print(x*y)

c1= Calc()
c1.mull(10,20)

#10. Explain in few words why we call the self in methods
self its to defin a variable that equal the class name
to make kontakt with class and self should always have place in functions

#11. What we mean with OOP 4 Pillars
encapsulation
inheritance
polymorphism
abstraction

we should use thise 4 methode when we writing code
#12. Why we use OOP in our code
it make code modular and faster and all programing language use oop
