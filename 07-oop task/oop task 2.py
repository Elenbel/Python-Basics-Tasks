# Python oop Task 2


#1. Create a new class names SciCalc with 3 methods , sum , mull , power all of them takes 2 argument x, y
class Scicalc:
    def sum(self,x,y):
        pass
        
    def mull(self,x,y):
        pass
    
    def power(self,x,y):
        pass
c1 = Scicalc()

#2. Sum return the sum of x and y
class Scicalc:
    def sum(self,x,y):
        return x+y
    def mull(self,x,y):
    def power(self,x,y):
c1 = Scicalc()
c1.sum(5,6)


#3. Mull return the multiplication of x and y

class Scicalc:
    def sum(self,x,y):
        
    def mull(self,x,y):
        return x*y
    def power(self,x,y):
        return x,y
c1 = Scicalc()
c1.mull(5,6)


#4. The power return x power y

class Scicalc:
    def sum(self,x,y):
        
    def mull(self,x,y):
        
    def power(self,x,y):
        return x,y
c1 = Scicalc()
c1.power(0,1)


#5. Take an object from the class and call the 3 methodswith any numbers

class Scicalc:
    def sum(self,x,y):
        return x+y
    def mull(self,x,y):
        return x*y
    def power(self,x,y):
        return x,y
c1 = Scicalc()
c1.sum(5,6)
c1.mull(5,6)
c1.power(0,1)


#6. Can we inherit from the class we created in the firsttask Calc

#7. Inherit from the Calc class , now remove theunneeded code the the SciCalc after inheriting

#8. call the 3 methods again from the SciCalc object

#9. Now you should see the same result as before

#10. Explain in few words what happened after inheriting
