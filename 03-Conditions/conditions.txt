1.Check if 10 is bigger than 15 or not?

x = 10
if x > 15 :
    print('x is bigger than 15')
if x < 15 :
    print('x is less than 15')


2. If 10 is not bigger than15 print x is smaller than 15

x = 10
if x > 15 :
    print('x is bigger than 15')
else  :
    print('x is smaller than 15')

3. In which cases we will use all?

 #if we have to many and in line.
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
if a == 10 and b ==20 and c == 30 :
    print('done')
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
if all([a == 10 ,b == 20 ,c == 30 ]) :
    print('done')


4. What is the differences between all, and

all : takes all variables in list with comma all value should be true.
and : put every variable with value than and next variables with value. all value shuld be true.

5. What is the differences between any, or

any its like or but takes list of variable with comma

a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
if a == 10 or b ==255 or c == 300 :
    print('done')
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
if any([a == 10 ,b == 205 ,c == 300 ]) :

6. If we need all the conditions to be true we will use ....

and 

7. What is the differences between if, elif

if : it used just one time if the condition was true of false and used with else 
elif: you can use as much you want. 

8. What is the differences between elif else 

else : it used just one time if the condition was not true of false
elif: you can use as much you want.

9. Can we use more than one elif?

yes 
 
10. Can we use more than one else?

no just one time 

11. write s simple ternary operator

x = 10
print('x = 10') if x == 10 else print('x != 10')

12. in elif, python will check all the conditions no matter what? 

yeah if the condition(if) was false and elif commes next line

13. in elif we use else for ... ?

else condition commes with if and elif if both of them was false then else will be true.

14. if we have this list [2,4,6,8,10]:

1. check to see if 4 in this list or not

if  4  in a:
    print('4 in the list ')

2. check to see if 4 and 6 in this list on not

if  4 and 6 in a:
    print('4,6 in the list ')


3. check to see if 3 or 6 in this list

print(' 3 is in the list ')if  3 in a else print(' 3 is in not the list ')
    
print(' 6 is in the list ')if  6 in a else print(' 6 is not in the list ')



4. check to see if 2, 4 and 5 in this list 

print(' 2 is in the list ')if  2 in a else print(' 2 is in not the list ')
    
print(' 4 is in the list ')if  4 in a else print(' 4 is not in the list ')
print(' 5 is in the list ')if  5 in a else print(' 5 is not in the list ')
