#1. With is the differences between '' "" '''  '''
 
#if we have some strin like names include (') we use double (" what's or it's ") to put all in string. the ''' Triple quotes are used to create multiline strings.
#Triple quotes can be used for docstrings, which are used to document functions, classes, and modules:

#2. Create a string with the name 'mystero'


a = 'mystro'




#3. Make the string letters capital

a = 'mystro'
a.upper()


#4. Create a list of values from 10 to 20


x = print(tuple( range(10,21)))




list_range = []
for x in range(10,21):
    list_range.append(x)
    
print(list_range)




#5. Add 30 to the end of the list

list_range.index(20)

ist_range.insert(11,30)
list_range

#6. Add 40 as the second element of the list
list_range.insert(2,40)

#7. Print how many elements in the list
len(list_range)

#8. replace the second element in the list with 100
list_range[2] = 100
list_range

#9. Create a tuple with values from 1 to 5 10. 

x = print(tuple( range(1,6)))  

#Can we add 10 to the end of the tuple?

# no but if we changit to list , we could

#11. Create a dict of value Mahmoud:28, ahmed:30

d = {'Mahmoud':28 , 'ahmed':30}
d.values()
d.get('Mahmoud')


#12. Print Mahmoud age from the dict

d.values()
d.get('Mahmoud')


#13. What is the differences between mutable and immutable data types ?
'''
 Mutable data: can be edit or changed
 immutable data: can not but is faster than mutable
